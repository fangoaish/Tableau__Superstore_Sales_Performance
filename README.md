# Superstore Sales Performance

## Project Overview
The [Sales Performance Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fang.wen.hsiao/viz/SupersotreSales_17111190533460/SuperstoreSalesPerformance) aims to provide actionable insights into the company's sales performance, focusing on key metrics such as Total Profit, Total Sales, Total Quantity, Profit by Subcategory, Sales by Segment, Order Distribution by Shipping Mode, and Order Distribution by Category. By leveraging these metrics, we aim to enhance our understanding of sales trends, identify areas of improvement, and drive strategic decision-making to optimize revenue and profitability.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Total Profit with % Difference from Previous Year
![Total Profit](https://github.com/fangoaish/Tableau__Superstore_Sales_Performance/assets/51399519/ef1e5500-5965-422d-9c2b-58fb27c10a2e)

**Insight**: Profit growth was consistent and increasing year over year, with significant jumps particularly between 2015 and 2016 (+32.74%) and a smaller yet steady increase into 2017 (+14.24%). This suggests effective cost management or improved sales efficiency.

**Recommendation**: Investigate specific changes or strategies implemented during 2015-2017 that drove profit increases, such as new product launches or enhanced marketing tactics. Continue to focus on these profitable strategies while exploring additional areas for cost reduction, such as sourcing or operational efficiencies.

### Total Sales with % Difference from Previous Year
![Total Sales](https://github.com/fangoaish/Tableau__Superstore_Sales_Performance/assets/51399519/4f9caac6-a105-491d-bfd4-24dbcddb0c41)

**Insight**: After a slight decrease in sales in 2015 (-2.83%), sales rebounded strongly in the following years, with a nearly 30% increase in 2016 and over 20% in 2017. This indicates recovery and growth, potentially driven by effective sales and marketing strategies.

**Recommendation**: Analyze the sales activities and market conditions that contributed to the recovery and growth post-2015. Double down on successful tactics and explore new markets or segments that could replicate this success. Also, identify and address the causes of the 2015 sales dip to prevent future declines.


### Total Quantity with % Difference from Previous Year
![Total Quantity](https://github.com/fangoaish/Tableau__Superstore_Sales_Performance/assets/51399519/fd69cc22-fbd2-43bd-bd4e-acaade78bd20)

**Insight**: Quantity sold consistently increased each year, with significant growth from 2015 onwards. This reflects growing demand and successful market penetration.

**Recommendation**: Continue to optimize inventory levels to match demand, preventing stock-outs and overstock situations. Explore bundling and cross-selling strategies to leverage the increasing demand, particularly in high-growth years.


### Profit by Subcategory

**Insight**: Some subcategories, like Copiers and Phones, are highly profitable, while others like Tables and Bookcases have shown losses. This indicates variability in product performance.

**Recommendation**: Allocate more resources to marketing and developing high-profit subcategories like Copiers and Phones. Evaluate and potentially phase out or revamp underperforming categories like Tables to improve profitability.



### Sales by Segment

**Insight**: The Consumer segment drives the majority of sales, significantly outperforming the Corporate and Home Office segments. This suggests that consumer-focused strategies are particularly effective.

**Recommendation**: Customize marketing campaigns to further penetrate the Consumer segment while exploring strategies to increase engagement and sales in the Corporate and Home Office segments. Consider segment-specific promotions or tailored product offerings.



### Order Distribution by Shipping Mode

**Insight**: Standard Class is the most common shipping mode, used significantly more than other methods. This preference for standard shipping suggests that speed may be less critical to customers than cost.

**Recommendation**: Optimize logistics to reduce costs and improve efficiency in Standard Class shipping. Evaluate the feasibility of enhancing service levels in faster shipping classes as a competitive advantage.



### Order Distribution by Category

**Insight**: Office Supplies is the most frequently ordered category, followed by Furniture and Technology. This indicates consistent demand and popularity of office supplies.

**Recommendation**: Ensure robust inventory management for Office Supplies to meet demand. Monitor sales trends in Furniture and Technology to adjust stock levels and marketing strategies appropriately, maximizing sales opportunities in these categories as well.


### Filter
We use the Country and State filter in this dashboard to provide users with the ability to analyze sales performance and trends at different geographic levels. By filtering data based on country and state, users can narrow down their focus to specific regions of interest. This enables them to gain insights into regional sales patterns, identify areas of high or low performance, and tailor strategies to specific geographic markets.

## Conclusion 
The exploratory data analysis of the Superstore dataset offers valuable insights into the company's sales performance, profitability, and operational dynamics over the years 2014 to 2017. Here are the key takeaways and strategic recommendations:

1. **Consistent Growth in Profit and Sales**:
  The company experienced consistent year-over-year growth in both profits and sales, especially notable after a slight sales dip in 2015. The recovery and subsequent growth suggest that the company has effectively implemented sales strategies and market adaptations to rebound and grow.

   **Strategic Action**: Continue leveraging the strategies that contributed to this rebound, such as targeted marketing campaigns, product diversification, and competitive pricing strategies. Further investigation into the causes of the 2015 dip could provide insights to avoid similar pitfalls in the future.

2. **Product Category Performance**:
  The analysis highlights significant disparities in profitability across different product subcategories. High-profit items like Copiers and Phones should be the focus of enhanced marketing efforts, while strategies should be devised to address the poor performance in Tables and Bookcases.

   **Strategic Action**: Prioritize high-performing subcategories with increased marketing budgets and sales initiatives. For underperforming subcategories, conduct market research to understand the lackluster performance and consider discontinuation, redesign, or strategic partnerships to enhance these lines.

3. **Segment-Specific Sales Insights**:
  The Consumer segment is the predominant revenue generator, indicating effective consumer-targeted strategies. However, there are opportunities to bolster the Corporate and Home Office segments.

   **Strategic Action**: Develop tailored marketing and product strategies for the Corporate and Home Office segments to better meet their specific needs and preferences, potentially increasing their contribution to overall sales.

4. **Operational Efficiencies in Shipping**:
  With Standard Class shipping being the most preferred option, there is a clear indication that customers favor cost over delivery speed.

    **Strategic Action**: Optimize Standard Class shipping to become more cost-effective and efficient. Explore opportunities to improve service in faster shipping options as a competitive differentiator, potentially increasing customer satisfaction and attracting a broader customer base.
  
5. **Inventory and Demand Management**:
  The consistent increase in the quantity of products sold year-over-year reflects strong demand, particularly for Office Supplies, which dominates order volumes.

  **Strategic Action**: Maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet the high demand for Office Supplies and closely monitor trends in Furniture and Technology to adjust stock and marketing efforts accordingly.

In conclusion, while the company shows robust signs of growth and profitability, there are areas that require strategic adjustments to maximize potential. By focusing on high-performing categories, enhancing segment-specific strategies, and optimizing logistical operations, the company can not only sustain but also accelerate its growth trajectory. Continuous monitoring and adaptation to market conditions will be essential to maintain this upward trend and address any emerging challenges effectively.
